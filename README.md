# Permadelete : a file shredding app

When a file is deleted, only a reference to the location of the file is deleted. In other words, the file system just "forgets" about the existence of the file. But the actually data, the 0's and 1's, still remain on the disk. They will eventually be replaced by other files and data, but this can take a long long time and during this time recovery softwares can be used to recover the "deleted" files. But file shredding apps like Permadelete make sure the files you delete can't be recovered. If you are the curious type, you can read more about [how Permadelete works](https://github.com/DevelopersTree/permadelete/wiki/How-Permadelete-works).
